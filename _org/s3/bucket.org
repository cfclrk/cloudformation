Parameters:

#+name: Params
| Param          | Value |

| DeploymentName | test  |

** DeploymentName

#+begin_src yaml
  DeploymentName:
    Type: String
    Description: A name for this deployment
#+end_src

A *deployment* is a deployed application, potentially comprised of many
CloudFormation stacks. This is sometimes called an "environment", but that is an
overloaded and confusing term. Use the =DeploymentName= to indicate which
logical deployment a stack belongs to.

If a deployment is completely specified by exactly one CloudFormation template,
the =DeploymentName= and the [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/pseudo-parameter-reference.html#cfn-pseudo-param-stackname][AWS::StackName]] refer to the same things. In that
case, consider not using a =DeploymentName= parameter.
