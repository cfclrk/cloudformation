* DeploymentName

A *deployment* is a complete deployed application, potentially comprised of many
CloudFormation stacks. This is sometimes called an "environment", but that is an
overloaded term. Use the =DeploymentName= to indicate which deployment a Stack
is part of.

#+begin_src yaml
  DeploymentName:
    Description: A name for this deployment
    Type: String
#+end_src
